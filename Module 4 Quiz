Question 3d
What is the main reason that each tree of a random forest only looks at a random subset of the features when building each node?

1 point

To increase interpretability of the model


To learn which features are not strong predictors


To reduce the computational complexity associated with training each of the trees needed for the random forest.


To improve generalization by reducing correlation among the trees and making the model more robust to bias.

Answer 3 - 'd' To improve generalization by reducing correlation among the trees and making the model more robust to bias.

Question 5 bd
Select which of the following statements are true.

1 point

For having an audience interpret the fitted model, a support vector machine would be a better choice than a decision tree.


For a model that won’t overfit a training set, Naive Bayes would be a better choice than a decision tree.


For a fitted model that doesn’t take up a lot of memory, KNN would be a better choice than logistic regression.


For predicting future sales of a clothing line, Linear regression would be a better choice than a decision tree regressor.

Answer 5 - 'bd' - 
                  For a model that won’t overfit a training set, Naive Bayes would be a better choice than a decision tree.

Question 7 0.067
A decision tree of depth 2 is visualized below. Using the `value` attribute of each leaf, 
find the accuracy score for the tree of depth 2 and the accuracy score for a tree of depth 1.
What is the improvement in accuracy between the model of depth 1 and the model of depth 2? (i.e. accuracy2 - accuracy1)

Which of the following features should be removed from the training of the model to prevent data leakage? (Select all that apply)

1 point

grafitti_status - Flag for graffiti violations


ticket_issued_date - Date and time the ticket was issued


agency_name - Agency that issued the ticket


compliance_detail - More information on why each ticket was marked compliant or non-compliant


collection_status - Flag for payments in collections

1 point

If time is a factor, remove any data related to the event of interest that doesn’t take place prior to the event.


Ensure that data is preprocessed outside of any cross validation folds.


Remove variables that a model in production wouldn’t have access to


Sanity check the model with an unseen validation set
